# Profiler
The profiler application is a powerful tool that allows wireless clients to be analysed based on the capabilities they display when they associate to a wireless network.

To activate the profiler, please start the profiler process via the front panel menu system options: 

```
Menu > Apps > Profiler > Start
``` 
(ensure you have a wireless NIC plugged in to a WLAN Pi USB port before starting the process)

Once the profiler is started, an SSID will be visible that will allow clients to be profiled.

To view clients results and reports, the following links may be used to view the client profile reports on the WLAN Pi:

* [Client profiles](/profiler/clients/)
* [Profile reports](/profiler/reports/)

Visit the WLAN Pi documentation site for more details about profiler: [link](https://wlan-pi.github.io/wlanpi-documentation/pkg_util_profiler/)
